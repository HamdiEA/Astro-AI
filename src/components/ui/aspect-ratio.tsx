/**
 * AstroVision: File overview — aspect-ratio.tsx
 * Purpose: Explain the role of this module/component in the app.
 * React notes:
 *  - Uses React function components and Hooks (useState/useEffect/useMemo as applicable).
 *  - Data flows top→down via props; events bubble up via callbacks.
 *  - Virtual DOM reconciles changes triggered by state updates efficiently.
 *  - Prefer pure, side-effect free rendering; isolate side-effects in useEffect.
